Web Frontend is the client-side portion of web applications that users interact with in their browsers.

Note: I use "Web Frontend" instead of "Frontend" because the Frontend-Backend architecture pattern also appears
in non-web contexts like [LLVM compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) design and [CPU microarchitecture](https://mitterandekole.medium.com/modern-cpu-architecture-2-microarchitecture-8bcd80ce52ae).
