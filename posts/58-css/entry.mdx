At [VADAVO](https://www.vadavo.com), the company where I work, we are in the process of creating
a [visual identity](https://ds.vadavo.com/), an aspect that I love, even when I don't have a creative neither marketing profile.

To achieve this, my coworker is creating a design system in Figma, and I am in charge of implementing it in CSS.
It's quite an important project that requires taking it seriously, writing maintainable and well-documented stylesheets.

This isn't the first time I've faced something like this. When I wrote the CSS stylesheet for this blog, I
already experimented with a way of writing CSS that would help me make it maintainable. However, back then,
I didn't have a design made in Figma by a professional UI designer.

## CSS Architecture
Back then I took the [CSS architecture course from Codely that Rafa and Núria](https://codely.com/en/courses/css-architecture-sah6) created.
I learned patterns for [class naming](https://getbem.com/) and for [component organization](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/). However, the solution I opted
for is more personal and simpler.

## Naming Patterns

I dislike patterns like BEM because they generate very long class names, and when using them on HTML code,
it becomes tiring to look at and difficult to maintain when seeing tags with such long class names.

This would be an example of a card component, with a variant and a nested element using BEM:

```html
<div class="alert alert--info">
    <div class="alert__header">Thank you!</div>
    <div class="alert__body">
        <p>Thanks for reading IOKode.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

This is a simple example on there are few variants, modifiers or nested elements, and it's already painful
to my eyes. In the past I had to deal with [Metronic 5](https://keenthemes.com/metronic), a complete HTML template that uses BEM, and it was hell.

Instead, I prefer to simply use a class name, both for the component and for its modifications and nested components,
like this:

```html
<div class="alert info">
    <div class="header">Thank you!</div>
    <div class="body">
        <p>Thanks for reading IOKode.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

For me, this is the maximum possible simplicity: a class that indicates it's a card, another class for the variant
without repeating the component name and a class for nested components without repeating the class name
of the component they belong to.

### Avoiding Collisions

Since the first version of CSS, there have been tools to achieve this simplicity without class collisions, using
adjacent and nesting selectors. However, writing these in stylesheets was cumbersome and led to stylesheets complicated
to maintain.

However, we've had CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less at our disposal for many years now, which solve this problem
thanks to the nesting feature. Nesting has been so popular that it's even used for BEM and was introduced into the
CSS specification in 2023.

## Organization patterns

I like those patterns more than the naming patterns, but I found them a bit too complex for my needs. I usually don't
need to split a component into a lot of different parts. In my case, I usually group components by category, and then
I put each component in a separate source file.

## The difference between styles and layout

When I create components, I never define things like padding or margin outside the component. The component itself
should be placed in any part of the page. The pages have their own layout that positions the components.

## The `z-index` Property

It's very common to use the `999999999` value for the `z-index` property. That's an aberration.
In my case, it's very rare to need more than two or three layers on the z axis, so I always start with `1`
and then I increment by `1` for each layer. The maximum value I needed was `2`.

## The CSS variables and the custom properties

A lot of CSS pre-processors allow you to define CSS variables and then use them in your stylesheets. In the past,
I used to use them to define values from the design system like colors or fonts. Those "variables" in reality are
more like to constants than variables because they are just replaced in the resulting CSS.

Today I do not recomment anymore since CSS has native support for custom properties. The main advantage of using
custom properties is that they can be modified in runtime, so you can have a theme file that it just changes the
values of the custom properties. In this blog, I use them for switching between light and dark themes.

In any case, if the value won't change, then you can use your pre-processors variables.
