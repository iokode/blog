At [VADAVO](https://www.vadavo.com), the company on which I work, we are in the process of creating a [visual identity](https://ds.vadavo.com/), an aspect
that I love, even when I don't have a creative neither marketing profile.

To achieve this, my UX designer coworker is creating a design system in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and I am in charge of implementing it in CSS.
It's an important project that requires taking it seriously, so writing maintainable and well-documented stylesheets
is a must.

This isn't the first time I've faced something like this. When I wrote the CSS stylesheet for this blog, I
already experimented with a way of writing CSS that would help me make it maintainable. However,
I didn't have a design made in Figma by a professional UI designer (it isn't necessary to have one).

## CSS Architecture
Some years ago, I took the [CSS architecture course from Codely](https://codely.com/en/courses/css-architecture-sah6) that Rafa and Núria created. In this course,
I learned patterns for [class naming](https://getbem.com/) and for [component organization](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/). However, the solution I opted for
is more personal and simpler.

## Naming Patterns
Those patterns are a set of rules on how to name classes and ids.

I dislike patterns like BEM because they generate very long class names and, when using them on HTML code,
it becomes difficult to maintain with such long class names. This is the same reason why I dislike [Tailwind](https://x.com/Montyclt/status/1805653015225155991).

This would be an example of a card component, with a variant and a nested element using BEM:

```html
<div class="alert alert--info">
    <div class="alert__header">Thank you!</div>
    <div class="alert__body">
        <p>Thanks for reading IOKode.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

This is a simple example on there are few variants, modifiers or nested elements, and it's already painful
to my eyes. In the past I had to deal with [Metronic 5](https://keenthemes.com/metronic), a complete HTML template that uses BEM, and it was hell.

Patterns like the Bootstrap's naming pattern are better for me, but I dislike repeating the class for variants.

Instead, I prefer to use a simple class name, both for the component and for its modifications and nested components,
without repeating them, like this:

```html
<div class="alert info">
    <div class="header">Thank you!</div>
    <div class="body">
        <p>Thanks for reading IOKode.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

For me, this is the perfect naming pattern: a class that indicates the component (a card), another class for the variant
without repeating the component name and a class for nested components without repeating the class name
of the component they belong to.

An important thing here that I do is to [use complete class names and avoid abbreviations](https://iokode.blog/posts/alergia-vocales/). I prefer `button`
over `btn`.

### Avoiding Collisions
`info`, `header` or `body` are generic class names and selecting it directly could lead to collisions.

Since the first version of CSS, there have been tools to achieve this simplicity without class collisions, using
[combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Combinators). However, writing these selectors in stylesheets was cumbersome
and led to stylesheets complicated to maintain.

CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less solved this problem with the [nesting feature](!todo CSS nesting). Nesting has been so popular
that it's even used for BEM and was introduced into the CSS specification in 2023.

In a component like the above card, I always use a child combinator like this:

```css
.card {
    /* ... */

    > .header {
        /* ... */
    }

    > .body {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

## Organizational patterns
In general, I like those patterns more than the naming patterns, but I found patterns like Atomic Design a bit too
complex for my needs. I usually don't need to split a component into a lot of different parts. In my case, my
organizational pattern is based on three types of stylesheet files: properties, components and layout.

### Properties
Properties are some decisions that affect all components and layouts, like the colors, fonts, spacing, sizes, etc. 
I usually put them in specific files using [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

### The difference between styles and layout
When I create components, I never define things like padding or margin outside the component. The component itself
should be placed in any part of the page. The pages have their own layout that positions the components.

### Directory structure summary
``` !todo convert to directory structure
# properties/
## colors.css
## fonts.css
## borders.css
# components/
## button.css
## card.css
## input.css
```

A `layout` directory doesn't exist here because I set the layout with the page that it belongs.

## The `z-index` Property
It's very common to use the `999999999` value for the `z-index` property. That's an aberration.
In my case, it's very rare to need more than two or three layers on the z axis, so I always start with `1`
and then I increment by `1` for each layer. The maximum value I needed was `2`.

## The CSS variables and the custom properties
A lot of CSS pre-processors allow you to define CSS variables and then use them in your stylesheets. In the past,
I used to use them to define values from the design system like colors or fonts. Those "variables" in reality are
more like to constants than variables because they are just replaced in the resulting CSS.

Today I do not recomment anymore since CSS has native support for custom properties. The main advantage of using
custom properties is that they could vary their value in runtime, so you can have a theme file that it just changes the
values of the custom properties or based on media queries. In this blog, I use them for switching between light
and dark themes.

Only in the case that you're sure a value won't change, then you can use your pre-processors variables, but I don't
recommend using a pre-processor anymore (I'll explain it later in this post).
