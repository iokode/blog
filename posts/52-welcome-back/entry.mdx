<Alert severity="info">
    **TL;DR**
    - After 2 years of inactivity, **IOKode is back**.
    - The blog is now entirely in **English** to support projects like **OpinionatedFramework** and reach a wider audience.
    - All Spanish posts remain online; key ones will be translated.
    - A new [**Constitution**](https://www.notion.so/IOKode-Constitution-236b46ae0b7a802093c6f034a4eb74f1?pvs=21) sets the project’s purpose and collaboration guidelines.
    - The blog is now **open to collaborators**: write posts, donate, fix content via GitHub PRs, comment, or share.
    - **Butterfly**, the blog engine, has been rewritten from ASP.NET Core → Astro. More details in a [dedicated post](https://iokode.blog/post/rocket).
    - The **YouTube and Twitch channels are discontinued**.
</Alert>

The last post on this blog was published in 2023 (except the [SceneBeta](https://iokode.blog/posts/legacy/scenebeta)’s post).
Around the same time, both the X (formerly Twitter) profile and the LinkedIn page also went inactive.

At first glance, this might suggest that the IOKode project was abandoned—but **that’s not the case**. During this
time, I actively worked on IOKode’s subprojects, particularly **OpinionatedFramework**, which remained in development.

Now, after two years of inactivity, the blog returns in a **new era**.

## The English era

When I first launched this blog, my goal was to create more **Spanish-language content** since English-language
resources were already abundant.

As the blog evolved, however, I began working on the **OpinionatedFramework** project alongside it. To make
OpinionatedFramework relevant, it needs the visibility and reach of an **English-language blog**. That’s why
I’ve decided to **switch IOKode entirely to English**.

Other IOKode subprojects will also benefit from this shift: publishing in English gives them broader visibility
and support.

Another reason for this shift is personal: **writing in English will help me improve my skills.**

### **What about the existing Spanish content?**

For preservation purposes, all original Spanish posts will remain available. The most important posts will be
translated.

## The constitution

[The constitution](https://iokode.blog/constitution) is a special blog post that explains the project's purpose
and establishes collaboration guidelines. It serves as both a mission statement and an ethical framework.

It won’t matter much for everyday readers, but it’s very important for me as the administrator: it serves as a
**mission statement, ethical framework, and decision-making guide**. Collaborators are encouraged to read it.

## Welcome collaborators

During the Spanish era, I was the sole author of all posts published on IOKode. In this new era, I'm opening
the blog to collaborators in multiple ways:

- **Write:** Guest authors are welcome to publish here. Free speech is constitutionally guaranteed. Posts can be tutorials, opinions, deep dives, commentary on industry trends, or anything else you’d like to share.
- **Fix:** Posts are now plain Markdown files in a GitHub repository, so anyone can submit pull requests to correct typos, improve clarity, or add information.
- **Donate:** If you’d like to help sustain the project, you can contribute through GitHub Sponsors.
- **Comment:** Every post has a comments section. Whether you want to give feedback, ask questions, or share your experience, leaving a **comment** is a great way to contribute.
- **Share:** Not ready to write or donate? No problem. You can still help a lot by simply **sharing posts** you find useful. Repost them on X, LinkedIn, Reddit, or just send them to a friend.

If you’d like to publish a post, please make sure to read [**Section 2 of the Constitution**](https://iokode.blog/constitution).

## Butterfly in a Rocket

Butterfly, the blog engine powering IOKode, was originally written in ASP.NET Core (C#). For this new era,
I've completely rewritten it in Astro (TypeScript).

There are a lot of changes, some of them necessary to achieve the constitution, others are just performance changes.

All details about these changes are available in the [dedicated post](https://iokode.blog/posts/rocket).

## End of YouTube and Twitch channels

Initially, I planned to create a comprehensive content platform combining written blog posts with media
content on YouTube and Twitch. Though I created the channels and even did some
[streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXyzPIrJZLo) and videos, I realized this wasn't the direction
I wanted to take.

While I'm not ruling out the possibility of someone else continuing these channels, I personally won't
be pursuing them.
