This weekend I installed Omarchy, and
[it set a `~/.gitconfig` file that configures the default branch name to `master`](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/master/install/config/git.sh).

This morning I saw this [DHH's tweet about that decision](https://x.com/dhh/status/1972765204208603631), and then,
I read his [blog post about that](https://world.hey.com/dhh/forcing-master-to-main-was-a-good-faith-exploit-b21ee30c).

I agree, so I'm changing all IOKode's projects' defaults to master right now (except for the archived ones).
This post explains why.

As of today, I was using 'main' just because GitHub changed the default branch name, which I considered irrelevant,
and because I was too lazy to change it back to 'master'.

I always disagreed with [the reasons](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/), but at least "main"
is a good name that represents the concept.

Regarding DHH's post, he is true. If we let this "woke insanity" win these decisions, then their egos inflate,
and they become far worse, turning toxic against anyone who won't comply with their crazy ideas.

As DHH said, when we let them "win a battle", then they go to the next, and to the next. He linked a [guide from the University
of Washington with an absurd list of words that should be changed](https://it.uw.edu/guides/identity-diversity-inclusion/inclusive-language-guide/).

But that is not the main problem. The main problem is that letting them "win a battle" means that we are
saying "yes, you are right" so they believe that they are "the good ones" and then attack people who don't
agree with them.

I experienced it when [I just said that I don't care about the ideas of others who contribute to the IOKode project](https://x.com/Montyclt/status/1610976079770181632)
(see the replies and the quotes). I was attacked, insulted and blocked.

Note that I still do not care about the ideas of others who contribute to the IOKode project, I let these insane
people contribute here, but I won't accept any of their insane suggestions in this project.
Following [the Constitution](https://iokode.blog/constitution), I'll evaluate only the content of the contribution,
not the person who contributed it or their ideas. Just like [Linus does for the Linux project](https://www.osnews.com/story/21887/linus-microsoft-hatred-is-a-disease/).

For me, it's absurd to avoid contributing to a project due to personal thoughts of the project lead (or any other
contributor) that do not affect the project itself. I can understand it when it affects the project, like [Guido
van Rossum resigning from his BDFL role due to difference thoughts about the `:=` operator in Python](https://lwn.net/Articles/759654/).
I just cannot understand things like the [Plan Vert](https://github.com/Plan-Vert/open-letter).

And I think that nobody deserves to be attacked by people who do not agree with my own thoughts, so I won't
accept any suggestions of this type. I will never say to these people that they are right. Because they are not.
