Hi, I'm Ivan. I'm a software developer specialized in [.NET](/tags/dotnet), the
creator of the IOKode project, and I'm the head of the software department at [VADAVO](https://www.vadavo.com).

I was born in 1995, and I learned HTML in my childhood (in primary school) with the
[WebMaestro guide from Francisco Arocena](https://web.archive.org/web/20200310185904/https:/ldc.usb.ve/~vtheok/webmaestro/).

In my adolescence, I began programming with [Lua tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/20220929210958/https://psp.scenebeta.com/tutorial/tutoriales-para-programar-en-lua-para-psp)
in the SceneBeta.com community for the Sony PSP.

Over the years, I experimented with a lot of different languages, including Lua, C, Visual Basic
(classic and .NET), Java, PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust and the web stack (HTML5, CSS
and JavaScript/TypeScript). However, my main experience is with PHP, C#, and the web stack.

Currently, in the professional world, I lead a small team of three developers (myself included).
